# TAPF-SCM (Supply Chain Management)

# ABOUT THE NGO
The Akshaya Patra Foundation is an NGO in India headquartered in Bengaluru. Our
organisation strives to eliminate classroom hunger by implementing the Mid-Day Meal
Scheme in the government schools and government-aided schools. Alongside, Akshaya
Patra also aims at countering malnutrition and supporting the right to education of
socio-economically disadvantaged children.Today, Akshaya Patra is the world’s largest (not-for-profit run) Mid-Day Meal
Programme serving wholesome food every school day to over 1.8 million children from
19,039 schools across 12 states & 2 Union territories of India.

# Project
The aim of the project is to build an application for the delivery person to update
his/ her travel status so that TAPF admins can track the deliveries.Since the end users might not be technologically proficient, the application was to
be deployed in the simplest possible way with minimal external dependencies.
The application was also to be architecture and system independent, and easily
portable.

This is a working website. The details are as follows:

# CONCLUSION
A very important aspect of this project has been our contribution to the
community. We as student developers have successfully deployed an
application which solves a major recurrent problem for an organisation and
increases their productivity.
This project has been an enriching experience for all of us and has
widened our perspective on the way in which we can contribute to society
using our technical prowess.
